# Building a Simple Kittens API

This is a [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/apis?ref=lnav#your-task-1) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) where I set up a Rails app to be a data-producing API.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Then, run the server:

```
$ rails server
```
